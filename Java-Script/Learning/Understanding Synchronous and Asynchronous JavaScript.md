Okay, let's break down the concepts from the text with examples.

1.  **Synchronous Execution:**

    - JavaScript runs code one line at a time, in order. It must finish executing one line before moving to the next.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      console.log("First");
      console.log("Second");
      console.log("Third");
      ```
      _Output:_
      ```
      First
      Second
      Third
      ```
      Each `console.log` runs only after the previous one has completed.

2.  **Function Calls & Execution Context:**

    - When a function is called, JavaScript pauses the current execution, creates a _new execution context_ for that function, runs the code inside the function, and then returns to where it left off.
    - Each execution context has its own private memory (scope) for its variables (like parameters and local variables).
    - **Example (based on the text):**

      ```javascript
      // Global Execution Context starts
      const norm = 3; // Stored in Global Memory
      function multiplyByTwo(inputNumber) {
        // Function definition stored in Global Memory
        // Function Execution Context starts when called
        const result = inputNumber * 2; // 'result' stored in Function's Local Memory
        return result;
        // Function Execution Context ends
      }

      console.log("Before function call"); // Runs first in Global

      const output = multiplyByTwo(norm); // Pause Global, create Function Context
      // Inside function: inputNumber = 3, result = 6
      // Return 6, destroy Function Context, resume Global
      // 'output' = 6, stored in Global Memory

      console.log("After function call"); // Runs after function completes
      console.log(output); // Runs last in Global
      ```

      _Output:_

      ```
      Before function call
      After function call
      6
      ```

      Notice how "After function call" only prints _after_ `multiplyByTwo` has completely finished and returned its value. The main (global) thread waits.

3.  **The "Problem" with Synchronicity (Leading to Asynchronicity):**

    - If a line of code takes a long time to execute (like fetching data from a server over the internet), a purely synchronous language would freeze everything else until that slow task is done. Imagine clicking a button on a website, and the entire page becomes unresponsive for 5 seconds while it waits for data.
    - **Conceptual Example:**

      ```javascript
      function simulateSlowNetworkRequest() {
        // Imagine this takes 5 seconds to get data from a server
        console.log("Starting slow task...");
        // --- FAKE DELAY ---
        const startTime = Date.now();
        while (Date.now() - startTime < 5000) {
          // Do nothing, just wait
        }
        // --- END FAKE DELAY ---
        console.log("Slow task finished!");
        return "Data from server";
      }

      console.log("App started");
      const data = simulateSlowNetworkRequest(); // The entire script PAUSES here for 5 seconds
      console.log("Received data:", data);
      console.log("App finished"); // This only runs after the 5-second pause

      // If this were in a browser, the UI would be frozen during the 5-second wait.
      ```

      _Output (with a 5-second delay between the 2nd and 3rd lines):_

      ```
      App started
      Starting slow task...
      Slow task finished!
      Received data: Data from server
      App finished
      ```

    - This limitation is why JavaScript developed asynchronous features (like callbacks, Promises, async/await mentioned in the text) to handle slow operations without blocking the main thread. These allow the slow task to start, let the rest of the code continue running, and then handle the result of the slow task later when it's ready.
