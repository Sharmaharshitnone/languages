Sure! Let's break this down in **simple terms** and with **examples**, so you understand what this programming problem is asking.

---

## 🧠 **What’s the problem about?**

You’re given a list of integers (called an array).  
Your task is to find **all possible sequences (subsequences)** from this list that:

1. Are **non-decreasing** (numbers don’t go down).
    
2. Have **at least two numbers**.
    
3. Are printed in **lexicographical order** (like dictionary order).
    

---

## 💡 **What’s a “subsequence”?**

A **subsequence** is a sequence you can get by removing some elements (or none), but **keeping the order**.

For example, if your array is:

```
[4, 6, 7, 7]
```

Then some **valid subsequences** (in order) are:

- [4, 6]
    
- [6, 7]
    
- [4, 6, 7]
    
- [4, 7, 7]
    
- [7, 7]
    

You’re supposed to find **all** such subsequences that:

- Are in non-decreasing order (each number is greater than or equal to the one before it).
    
- Have at least 2 elements.
    

---

## ✅ **What’s “non-decreasing”?**

It means:

- Numbers can stay the same or get bigger.
    
- So `4 6 7` ✅ is fine.
    
- But `6 4` ❌ is not allowed (because 4 < 6).
    

---

## 🧾 **What’s “lexicographically sorted order”?**

It means you sort the output like words in a dictionary.

For example, sorting these:

```
[4, 6]
[4, 7]
[4, 6, 7]
```

would give:

```
[4, 6]
[4, 6, 7]
[4, 7]
```

Why? Because:

- [4, 6] comes before [4, 6, 7] (since it's shorter but same starting).
    
- [4, 6, 7] comes before [4, 7] (6 < 7 at the second number).
    

---

## 🧪 **Example from the problem**

Input:

```
4
4 6 7 7
```

You need to find all non-decreasing subsequences with at least 2 numbers.

Expected Output:

```
4 6  
4 6 7  
4 6 7 7  
4 7  
4 7 7  
6 7  
6 7 7  
7 7
```

These are:

- All valid (non-decreasing)
    
- Have 2 or more numbers
    
- And are sorted lexicographically
    

---

## 🔧 **Key Constraints**

- Array length is small (1 to 15) → Brute force is okay
    
- No using built-in libraries that directly solve it → You must write your own logic
    
- Elements can be negative or positive (from -100 to 100)
    

---

## ✨ Summary of What You Need to Do:

1. Go through all **combinations** of numbers (backtracking helps).
    
2. Check if the combination is:
    
    - **Non-decreasing**
        
    - Has **at least 2 numbers**
        
3. Add it to the result (use a set to avoid duplicates).
    
4. Finally, **sort** the results in lexicographical order and **print**.
    

---

Would you like a simple C++ code to understand how it can be done step by step?

Awesome! Let's solve it step-by-step in **C++** using **backtracking**.  
We’ll also avoid duplicates and finally sort the result lexicographically.

---

## ✅ **Approach Summary:**

1. Use a helper function (`backtrack`) to explore all subsequences.
    
2. At each step, decide to **include** or **not include** a number.
    
3. Use a **set** to avoid duplicates.
    
4. After collecting all valid subsequences, sort them and print.
    

---

## 🧠 **Why use a `set<vector<int>>`?**

Because:

- It **automatically removes duplicates**.
    
- And keeps things sorted in lexicographical order.
    

---

## 🧾 **C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

set<vector<int>> result;

void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& temp, int start) {
    if (temp.size() >= 2) {
        result.insert(temp); // only add if 2 or more elements
    }
    
    for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (temp.empty() || nums[i] >= temp.back()) {
            temp.push_back(nums[i]);
            backtrack(nums, temp, i + 1);
            temp.pop_back(); // backtrack
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> nums(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> nums[i];
    
    vector<int> temp;
    backtrack(nums, temp, 0);
    
    for (auto seq : result) {
        for (int num : seq)
            cout << num << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 🧪 **Example Input**

```
4
4 6 7 7
```

## ✅ Output:

```
4 6  
4 6 7  
4 6 7 7  
4 7  
4 7 7  
6 7  
6 7 7  
7 7
```

## 📌 Key Takeaways:

- Use **backtracking** to explore all paths.
    
- Check for **non-decreasing** using `nums[i] >= temp.back()`.
    
- Store valid results in a **set** to remove duplicates and auto-sort.
    
- Finally, **print** each sequence.
