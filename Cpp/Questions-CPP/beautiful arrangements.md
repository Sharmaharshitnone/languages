Sure! Let's break this down in simple words with examples:

---

### ðŸ§  **Whatâ€™s the problem about?**

You are given a number `n`. From 1 to `n`, you can make **different arrangements** (called permutations). Some of these arrangements are called **"beautiful arrangements"**.

---

### ðŸ¤” **What is a beautiful arrangement?**

An arrangement is **beautiful** if for every position `i` (starting from 1), the number at that position, let's call it `perm[i]`, follows **one of these two rules**:

1. `perm[i]` is divisible by `i`
    
    - Example: if `perm[2] = 4`, and `4 % 2 == 0`, this is good âœ…
        
2. `i` is divisible by `perm[i]`
    
    - Example: if `perm[2] = 1`, and `2 % 1 == 0`, this is also good âœ…
        

---

### ðŸ“¦ **Input:**

A number `n`.  
This means you're working with the numbers: `1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**

Find how many of the total arrangements of `1` to `n` are **beautiful**.

---

### âœ… **Examples:**

#### Example 1:

**Input:** `n = 2`  
Possible arrangements of [1, 2] are:

- `[1, 2]`
    
    - `perm[1] = 1 â†’ 1 % 1 == 0` âœ…
        
    - `perm[2] = 2 â†’ 2 % 2 == 0` âœ…
        
    - âœ… Beautiful
        
- `[2, 1]`
    
    - `perm[1] = 2 â†’ 2 % 1 == 0` âœ…
        
    - `perm[2] = 1 â†’ 2 % 1 == 0` âœ…
        
    - âœ… Beautiful
        

So the answer is **2**.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:** `n = 1`  
Only one arrangement: `[1]`

- `perm[1] = 1 â†’ 1 % 1 == 0` âœ…
    
- âœ… Beautiful
    

Answer is **1**.

---

### ðŸ§  **Key Concepts:**

1. **Permutations**: All possible ways to arrange the numbers from `1` to `n`.
    
2. **Check conditions** for each position `i`:
    
    - Is `perm[i] % i == 0`?
        
    - OR is `i % perm[i] == 0`?
        

If **yes for all `i`**, the arrangement is **beautiful**.

---

Want me to show how to write the code for this in a simple way too?

Nice ðŸ˜Ž Letâ€™s write it step by step in C++.  
We'll use **backtracking**, a common technique for trying all possible arrangements while pruning bad ones early.

---

### âœ… Step-by-step Plan:

1. Try placing numbers from 1 to n in positions 1 to n.
    
2. For each position `i`, try numbers `1 to n` that haven't been used yet.
    
3. Check if the number is valid at position `i` using:
    
    - `num % i == 0 || i % num == 0`
        
4. Count all valid full arrangements.

### ðŸ§  Code in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int count = 0;

void backtrack(int pos, int n, vector<bool>& used) {
    if (pos > n) {
        count++;
        return;
    }

    for (int num = 1; num <= n; num++) {
        if (!used[num] && (num % pos == 0 || pos % num == 0)) {
            used[num] = true;
            backtrack(pos + 1, n, used);
            used[num] = false;
        }
    }
}

int countBeautifulArrangements(int n) {
    vector<bool> used(n + 1, false); // index 1 to n
    backtrack(1, n, used);
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    cout << countBeautifulArrangements(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
