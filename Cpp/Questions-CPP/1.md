I'll analyze the problems in your workspace and arrange them from least to hardest. Let me take a look at the code complexity, algorithms used, and concepts required to solve each problem.I'll analyze the problems in your workspace and arrange them from least to hardest difficulty. After reviewing the code files, here's my assessment:

## Easy (Basic programming concepts and algorithms):

1. **printN21.cpp** - Simple recursion to sum numbers from 1 to n
2. **Print-N-times.cpp** - Basic recursion to print numbers in a range
3. **parantheseisBalance.cpp** - Simple stack implementation to check balanced parentheses
4. **MaxSubarray.cpp** - Finding maximum element in sliding window using brute force

## Medium (Some algorithmic thinking required):

5. **generateSubsequencesOfString.cpp** - Generate all subsequences using recursion
6. **GenerateBinaryStringsWithoutConsecutive1s.cpp** - Recursive string generation with constraints
7. **FruitsIntoBasket.cpp** - Sliding window problem with a set data structure
8. **GenerateAllSubsets.cpp** - Generating all subsets using backtracking
9. **PhoneCombinations.cpp** - Letter combinations of phone numbers using recursion
10. **TrueFalse.cpp** - Sliding window with character flipping constraints
11. **MaxConsecutiveOnesAfterFlippingAtMostK0s.cpp** - Sliding window with flip constraints
12. **FriendRequests.cpp** - Two-pointer comparison with specific conditions
13. **SumofRangesSubarray.cpp** - Computing range differences in subarrays

## Hard (Advanced algorithms and data structures):

14. **GenerateParantheses.cpp** - Generating valid parentheses using backtracking
15. **niceSubarrays.cpp** - Subarray counting with specific conditions
16. **CombinationSum.cpp** - Finding combinations that sum to target using backtracking
17. **CombinationSumII.cpp** - Similar to above but with no duplicates
18. **RemoveElementsFromArrayWithSumEqualToK.cpp** - Two-pointer technique with specific operations
19. **LongestPalindromicSubstring.cpp** - Expand around center approach for palindromes
20. **KthSmallestFraction.cpp** - Fraction sorting and selection
21. **RemoveKdigits.cpp** - Stack-based greedy approach for digit removal
22. **CelebrityProblem.cpp** - Efficient approach to find a "celebrity" in a graph
23. **AsteroidCollision.cpp** - Stack-based simulation of asteroid collisions

## Very Hard (Complex algorithms and techniques):

24. **KokoBanana.cpp** - Binary search with constraint checking
25. **LargestRectangleInHistogram.cpp** - Stack-based algorithm for rectangle calculation
26. **TrappingRainwater.cpp** - Two-pointer or stack technique for trapping water
27. **N-Queen-Problem.cpp** - Backtracking with constraint checking for N-Queens
28. **SumofSubarrayMin.cpp** - Stack-based approach for minimum subarray sums
29. **generateNonDecreasingSubsequences.cpp** - Complex backtracking with non-decreasing constraint

## Prefix, Postfix, Infix Conversions (Specialized knowledge):

These problems involve expression conversions and are relatively specialized:

30. **InfixToPostfix.cpp**
31. **infixToPrefix.cpp**
32. **PostfixToInfix.cpp**
33. **PostfixToPrefix.cpp**
34. **PrefixToInfix.cpp**
35. **PrefixToPostfix.cpp**

The arrangement is based on the algorithmic complexity, data structures used, and conceptual difficulty of each problem. The earliest problems require simple recursion or basic data structures, while the later ones involve more complex algorithms like backtracking with constraints, dynamic programming approaches, or advanced stack manipulations.

### Question: Longest Palindromic Substring Algorithm

The provided C++ code implements a function `longestPalindrome` that finds the longest palindromic substring within a given input string `s`. It uses an "expand around center" approach.

1.  **Explain the "expand around center" strategy.** How does the `expandAroundCenter` function work for both odd-length (like "aba") and even-length (like "abba") palindromes?
2.  **Analyze the time complexity** of the `longestPalindrome` function. Justify your answer based on the loops and function calls.
3.  **Analyze the space complexity** of the function. Does it use extra space proportional to the input size?
4.  **Consider edge cases:** How does the code handle empty strings, strings with a single character, and strings that are already palindromes?
