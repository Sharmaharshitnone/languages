Sure! Let's break it down in a simple way:

---

### 📌 **What is the problem about?**

You're given two numbers:

- **n**: The size of a set `{1, 2, 3, ..., n}`.
    
- **k**: A number telling you **which permutation** of this set you're supposed to return.
    

Your goal is to **find the k-th permutation** of the set in **lexicographical order** (like dictionary order).

---

### 🧠 **Key Concepts Explained**

#### 1. **Permutations**

A **permutation** is just a different way of arranging things.

Example with n = 3: The set is: `{1, 2, 3}`  
All permutations (arranged in lexicographical order):

```
1. 123
2. 132
3. 213
4. 231
5. 312
6. 321
```

So, if **k = 3**, the 3rd permutation is **213**.

---

#### 2. **Lexicographical Order**

This just means **"dictionary order"** — like how words are arranged:

- "123" comes before "132"
    
- "213" comes before "231"
    

We arrange all permutations like that and pick the k-th one.

---

#### 3. **How Many Permutations?**

There are `n!` (n factorial) permutations.

> n! means multiplying all numbers from 1 to n  
> Example:
> 
> - 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
>     
> - 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
>     

---

### ⚙️ **What you need to do (in code):**

You're not allowed to use shortcuts like built-in permutation functions. You need to **manually**:

1. **Figure out** how many permutations start with each number.
    
2. **Use division and modulo** to pick digits one by one.
    
3. **Build the final result** by removing used digits and repeating the logic.
    

---

### ✅ Example Walkthrough (n = 4, k = 9)

All permutations:

```
1. 1234
2. 1243
3. 1324
4. 1342
5. 1423
6. 1432
7. 2134
8. 2143
9. 2314 ✅ ← this is what we want
```

So your output should be: **2314**

Would you like me to walk through **how to solve this manually step-by-step** using math instead of generating all permutations?


Great! Let's go step by step and explain how to solve this in **C++** _without using any inbuilt functions for permutations_.

---

### 🧠 Goal:

Given two numbers `n` and `k`, return the **k-th permutation** of the sequence `1 to n` in **lexicographical order**.

---

### ✅ C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string getPermutation(int n, int k) {
    vector<int> numbers;
    int fact = 1;

    // Step 1: Create the list [1, 2, ..., n] and calculate n!
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        numbers.push_back(i);
        fact *= i;
    }

    k = k - 1; // Step 2: Convert k to 0-based index
    string result = "";

    // Step 3: Pick each digit using factorial logic
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        fact = fact / (n - i);  // Divide factorial to get block size
        int index = k / fact;   // Find which number to pick
        result += to_string(numbers[index]); // Add to result
        numbers.erase(numbers.begin() + index); // Remove used number
        k = k % fact; // Update k to the remainder
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    cout << getPermutation(n, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧩 Explanation (Line-by-line)

|Step|What It Does|Example for `n = 4, k = 9`|
|---|---|---|
|`vector<int> numbers`|Stores numbers 1 to n|`[1,2,3,4]`|
|`fact *= i`|Calculates n! (number of permutations)|`4! = 24`|
|`k = k - 1`|Change to 0-based index (because indexing starts at 0 in code)|`k = 8`|
|`fact = fact / (n - i)`|Size of each block for fixed digit|First: `24 / 4 = 6`|
|`index = k / fact`|Picks which number fits the current position|`8 / 6 = 1` → pick second number|
|`result += number[index]`|Adds that number to result|result = `"2"`|
|`erase()`|Remove the used number|numbers = `[1,3,4]`|
|`k = k % fact`|Update k for next round|`k = 8 % 6 = 2`|

This repeats until all digits are picked.

### 🧪 Sample Run

Input:

```
4 9
```

Output:

```
2314
```

Because the 9th permutation is `2314`.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Use math, not brute force.
    
- Use factorial to divide the problem.
    
- Work from left to right, picking digits one by one.
